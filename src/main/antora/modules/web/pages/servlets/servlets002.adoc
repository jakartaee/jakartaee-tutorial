== Servlet Lifecycle

The lifecycle of a servlet is controlled by the servlet container in which the servlet has been deployed.
When a request is mapped to a servlet, the servlet container performs the following steps:

. If an instance of the servlet does not exist, the servlet container:
.. Loads the servlet class
.. Creates an instance of the servlet class
.. Initializes the servlet instance by calling the `init` method
. The servlet container invokes the `service` method, passing request and response objects.

Initialization is covered in xref:servlets/servlets.adoc#_creating_and_initializing_a_servlet[Creating and Initializing a Servlet].
Service methods are discussed in xref:servlets/servlets.adoc#_writing_service_methods[Writing Service Methods].

If it needs to remove the servlet, the servlet container finalizes the servlet by calling the servlet's `destroy` method.
For more information, see xref:servlets/servlets.adoc#_finalizing_a_servlet[Finalizing a Servlet].
